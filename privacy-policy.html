  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 29 July 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Currency Converter (“we,” “us,” or “our”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices and compliance with applicable regulations.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Personal Data Collected:</strong> We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Currency Rate Fetching:</strong> Exchange rates are pulled from a remote server for informational display. No user data is sent to or stored on the server. All conversions happen locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>AdMob Integration:</strong> We use Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect anonymized device data (e.g., ad identifiers) to serve personalized content. Refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank">Google’s AdMob Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We do not use any third-party services beyond AdMob. No user data is ever shared externally.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from minors.</p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>No personal data is collected; therefore, data access or deletion rights under GDPR/CCPA do not apply.</p>

  <h2>6. Updates</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. When changes occur, the updated version will be made available at the same in-app link where users are directed to this page. We encourage you to check it periodically for any modifications.</p>
